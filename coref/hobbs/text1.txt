What's up, Gizmo? Do you see the red box over there? Drive towards it. Afterwards, turn around slowly for 90Â°. Oh, there's Mr. Miller, who is looking right at you. Say, "Hi!" to him, please. "Hello, pal." says Mr. Miller, "Welcome back." He wants you to help him carry this red can to the nearby pond, i.e. be a good friend. It's approximately 50 cm away from you. Lift up the can and go over there.
